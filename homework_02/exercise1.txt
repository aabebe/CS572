#1. Explain why do we want sometimes to use setImmediate
 instead of using setTimeout?

 ANS:- 
 If we want the call back in setImmediate to be executed first we use setImmediate instead of setTimeout.
 setImmediate() will always be executed before any 
 timers if scheduled within an I/O cycle, independently of
 how many timers are present.  

 #2. Explain the difference between process.nextTick and setImmediate

 ANS:-

 - process.nextTick will be executed first when the event loop checks the libv queue when V8 is free.
 - the order in which they appear in the queue matters.
 - process.nextTick fires immediately on the same phase
 - setImmediate will be executed on the following iteration or 'tick' of the event loop.
